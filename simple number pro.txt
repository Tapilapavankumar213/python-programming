The Evil number is another unique positive whole number with an even number of 1s in its binary representation.

example:

1) let n= 12

binary representation = 1100

# It has an even number of 1’s.  Therefore 12 is an evil number.

2) n= 4

binary representation = 100

It has an odd number of 1’s.  Therefore 4 is not an evil number


n=int(input())
k=bin(n)[2:]
c=0
for i in k:
    if i=="1":
        c+=1
if c%2==0:
    print("it evil number")
else:
    print("it is not")
Let the given number =25

The cube of the number = 25*25*25= 15625

The Given number 25 is present at the end.

Therefore, 25 is a Trimorphic Number.

The examples of the first few Trimorphic Numbers are 1, 4, 5, 6, 9, 24, 25, 49, 51, 75, 76, 99, 125, 249, 251, 375, 376, 499, and so on.

Given the number and the task is to check whether the given number is a Trimorphic Number or not.

n=int(input())
x=str(n)
s=len(x)
p=n**s
k=str(p)
if x==k[-s:]:
    print("it is trimorphic number")
else:
    print("it is not")

Happy Number :

If the repeating sum of the digits squared equals one, the number is said to be a Happy Number. If we continue this method and get outcome 1, we have a happy number. If the outcome is 4, it enters an infinite loop and is not a happy number. Let’s look at an example to help you grasp it better.

Given Number = 320
Square of the digits  = 32 + 22 + 02 = 13
Square of the digits  = 12 + 32 = 10
Square of the digits  = 12 + 02 = 1



n=int(input())
x=n
while x>=10:
    su=0
    while x>0:
        r=x%10
        su+=r**2
        x=x//10
    x=su
if x==1:
    print("it is happy number")
else:
    print("it is not happy number")



Peterson Number:

The Peterson number is the number whose sum of factorials of each digit equals the number itself. Let me give you an example to help you understand:

Examples:

Example1:

Input:

Given number =1
Output:

The given number [ 1 ] is a Peterson number


n=int(input())
x=n
su=0
while n>0:
    r=n%10
    fact=1
    for i in range(1,r+1):
        fact*=i
    n=n//10
    su+=fact
if su==x:
    print("it is peterson number")
else:
    print("it is not peterson number")

Spy number:

If the sum of a number’s digits equals the product of its digits, it’s called a Spy number. 1124,123,1412,132……

n=int(input())
x=n
su=0
pk=1
while n>0:
    r=n%10
    su+=r
    pk*=r

if su==pk:
    print("it is spy number")
else:
    print("it is not spy number")
